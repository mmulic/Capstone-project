# 🛰️ Frontend Planning & Design Document  
**Project:** Automated Disaster Damage Assessment from Aerial Imagery  

---

# 1) Overview

The frontend is responsible for delivering an interactive geospatial dashboard that:

- Displays pre- and post-disaster aerial imagery
- Overlays model-generated damage classifications
- Allows address and street-level querying
- Integrates a chatbot for disaster impact questions
- Provides an intuitive and responsive user experience

The frontend acts as the presentation and interaction layer between users and the Vision-Language Model (VLM) backend system.

# 3) Frontend Architecture Overview

React Application
│
├── Layout
│ ├── Navbar
│ ├── Sidebar (Chatbot)
│ └── Map View
│
├── Map Module
│ ├── Base Map (Tile Layer)
│ ├── Pre-Disaster Imagery Layer
│ ├── Post-Disaster Imagery Layer
│ ├── GeoJSON Damage Overlay
│ └── Legend + Filters
│
├── Chatbot Module
│ ├── Input Component

# 4) UI Layout Design

## Dashboard Layout Concept

- Interactive Map
- Chatbot Interface

### Key UI Elements

- Toggle switch for pre/post imagery
- Damage classification legend
- Address search bar above the map
- Loading indicators for model responses
- Tooltips on buildings for damage classification

---

# 5) Map & Geospatial Design

## Mapping Library: Leaflet

### Core Features

- Tile-based base map
- Overlay GeoJSON damage data
- Layer toggling for pre/post imagery
- Interactive building-level popups

### Damage Classification Color Scheme

| Damage Level | Color  |
|--------------|--------|
| No Damage    | Green  |
| Minor        | Yellow |
| Major        | Orange |
| Destroyed    | Red    |

### GeoJSON Handling

- Fetch GeoJSON from backend API
- Dynamically apply style based on classification
- Add hover and click interactions
- Optimize performance for large datasets

---

# 6) Chatbot Integration

The chatbot interface will:

- Accept natural language user queries
- Send POST requests to backend `/query` endpoint
- Display structured responses
- Maintain conversation history within the session

### Example

- "How many buildings are severely damaged on Elm Street?"
- "Summarize damage in this neighborhood."
- "What is the damage classification at 123 Main St?"

---

# 7) State Management Plan

Global state will manage:

- Selected imagery layer (pre/post)
- Damage overlay visibility
- Selected building or address
- Chat history
- Loading and error states

React Context API will centralize shared state across components.

---

# 8) API Integration Plan

|   Endpoint     | Method |           Purpose           |
|----------------|--------|-----------------------------|
| `/damage-data` | GET    | Fetch GeoJSON damage data   |
| `/query`       | POST   | Process chatbot queries     |
| `/evaluate`    | GET    | Retrieve evaluation metrics |

All API calls will:

- Include loading indicators
- Handle error responses
- Log failures for debugging

---

# 9) UI/UX Design Goals

- Clean, modern, and professional interface
- Clear visual distinction between damage levels
- Minimal cognitive overload
- Responsive design (desktop-first)
- Smooth map interactions
- Fast perceived performance

---

# 10) Development Milestones

### Phase 1 – Setup
- Initialize React project
- Configure Tailwind
- Integrate Leaflet

### Phase 2 – Map Development
- Render base map
- Implement GeoJSON overlay
- Add legend and classification styling

### Phase 3 – Chatbot Interface
- Build chat UI
- Connect to backend API
- Display structured responses

### Phase 4 – Integration & Testing
- Connect all components
- Handle edge cases
- Optimize performance

### Phase 5 – Deployment
- Deploy application
- Final UI polish
- Documentation and demo preparation

---

# Conclusion

The frontend will serve as the interactive visualization and user interaction layer of the system.  

By combining geospatial visualization, model output overlays, and conversational AI querying, the dashboard will provide a powerful and intuitive disaster damage assessment tool.
